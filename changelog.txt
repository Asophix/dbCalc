DBCalc - Functional Dependency Calculator
-----------------
v0.61 Update (Normal Form evaluation) - 2017.05.12.
Added Normal Form functionality! The highest NF appears just below
the keys list.
= Model:
  - Helper:
    * Added getNormalForm() to get a highest NF for a given relation and set.
    * Fixed findKeys() not removing repeating attributes.
= View:
  - New NF counter under the keys list.
  - Fixed attribute evaluation taking repeating attributes into account.
-----------------
v0.6 Update (Key Search) - 2017.05.11.
Added Key Search functionality! The keys are listed on the right-hand side,
below the evaluation table. Evaluate commences both key search and attribute
sort. 
= Model:
  - Main has been moved to View package.
  - Helper:
    * Added findKeys() to find keys in a certain FD set.
= View:
  - Evaluate got its own text fields to retrieve separate input.
  - New key lister under attribute evaluation (LRBN) table.
  - Fixed a number of status bar typos and value references.
-----------------
v0.55 Update - 2017.05.10.
Redesigned User Interface. There is room for future features, but overall layout looks
more polished. Most of the view code has been rewritten from scratch. 
= Model:
  - Helper:
    * Fixed minCover() not removing empty dependencies after last step.
  - Window:
    * Moved all subpanels and listeners into their respective classes.
    * Subpanels are static for easy availability in cross-references.
    * As a result, the code in Window has been greatly reduced.
= View:
  - Added a placeholder MenuBar to the top of the window.
  - Moved status bar to the top from the bottom.
  - Moved most panels to the middle.
  - Reduced number of FD sets to one.
  - Most action buttons got moved to the input panel.
  - Introduced new logo. :) 
-----------------
v0.5 Update (Attribute evaluation) - 2017.04.30.
Added Attribute evaluation functionality! A small table indicates in the bottom
left corner about each attribute's primary or secondary state.
= Model:
  - New Content class: supports evaluation functionality with a simple enum.
  - Relation field from Database removed.
  - Helper:
    * Added createSide() function to get attributes of a particular side from FDSet.
    * Added removeString() function to remove letters from a string (mainly to remove
      attributes from an existing set).
= View:
  - Added attribute evaluation table to the bottom left corner.
  - Added button for attribute evaluation, for both containers.
  - Status bar added on the bottom to make general use easier.
  - Several labels have been updated.
-----------------
v0.41g Change - 2017.04.29.
= Model:
  - FuncDepSet is now known as Database. Contains new field for own attributes.
    * Relation field is highly dysfunctional as of this version.
  - New Helper static class: contains non-entity related functions.
    As a result, some signatures have been changed and the length of Database
    has been greatly reduced.
    Coincidence: Helper itself is barely referenced from outside calls.
  - Slight optimization of listener functions.  
-----------------
v0.4 Update (Minimal cover) - 2017.04.24.
Added Min.cover functionality! Works for the current FD's in the set.
Min.cover does not pursue to have the least number of FD's in the result.
= Model:
  - Added minCover() function to calculate minimal cover of a FuncDepSet.
  - Added shrink() function to omit a particular dependency (useful at minCover function).
  - Added removeEmpty() function to remove FD's with empty members. 
= View:
  - Added button to calculate min. cover. Result appears in the respective textbox.
  - Removed The-One-Whom-We-Not-Name from the top title.
-----------------
v0.311 Hotfix - 2017.04.20.
= View:
  - Fixed FD input accepting trivial dependencies.
-----------------
