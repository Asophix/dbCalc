<h1>dbCalc></h1>
<p><b>dbCalc</b> is a simple application written in Java. It is a functional dependency calculator created as to practise Database Theory: Schema Decomposition. This project is currently undergoing development.<br>
Current version: 0.41g</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>dbCalc features a basic user interface, where functional dependencies can be added for up to 2 panels (representing FD sets). Each panel can handle its own content, as well as calculate minimal cover sets and closures for each FD sets. The results appear in the respective text area, under the current FD set.</p>
<p>The class diagram and its internal functions are viewable in the ModelGoon plugin, in Eclipse.</p>

<h2>Motivation and Terms of Use</h2>
<p>dbCalc is intended to be a fun but basic free-to-use software, as well as free to anyone to try optimizing (and so I encourage you!) the source-code for the greater good. I want to make this software handy for getting know and trying this utility in a "fun" field of Database Theory.</p>

<h2>To be added...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proper .pdf documentation for the utility.
<li>More functions and UI additions. 
</ul>
