<p><b>dbCalc</b> is a simple application written in Java. It is a functional dependency calculator created as to practise Database Theory: Schema Decomposition. This project is currently undergoing development.<br>
Current version: 0.55</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>dbCalc features a basic user interface, where functional dependencies can be added to a panel (representing FD sets). The utility can handle FD operations, as well as calculate minimal cover sets and closures for the FD set. The results appear in the respective text area or on the right hand side table.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
The current version supports:
<ul>
<li>Storage of functional dependencies.
<li>Calculation for an FD set's minimal cover.
<li>Calculation for an attribute set's closure.
<li>Evaluation for a given schema on a FD set's attributes.
</ul>

<h2>Motivation and Terms of Use</h2>
<p>dbCalc is intended to be a fun but basic free-to-use software, as well as free to anyone to try optimizing (and so I encourage you!) the source-code for the greater good. I want to make this software handy for getting know and trying this utility in a "fun" field of Database Theory.</p>

<h2>To be added...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proper .pdf documentation for the utility.
<li>Key search.
<li>Normal form evaluation.
<li>And many more... 
</ul>
